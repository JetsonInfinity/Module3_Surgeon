# Module 3 - Surgeon:

## Module3.py

Commands such as "grab tool" , "clean tool" and "turn off medical robot" can be used to make the robotic arm do various tasks. This replicates the real world application of a surgeon doing surgery and having the robot help grab tools. 

## Module3_problem(easy).py

Problem/Challenge:
Can you make the Robot only respond to the voice commands with it's name at the start? ex: "name grab tool"
Bonus Task: write the code in a way where we can easily change the name for all the commands using one line of code

## Module3_problem(medium).py

Can you make the Robot do certain tasks using voice commands?
Tasks: grab the tool, clean the tool
Bonus Task: stop the surgery loop -> get to the last line of code that prints Surgery is Done!
